<h2><br><br>About AquaInk</h2><br><br>

AquaInk's inception was only a matter of time. In 2007, founder Joel Higham started a small IT business in San Luis Obispo CA which eventually transformed into a Web Design company called WebForge. After many years of building websites mostly as a solo enterprise, Joel realized that it was time to expand the business into something bigger.<br><br>

The past several years were spent building custom web pages that performed specific functions. Eventually projects would come along that were grand in scope, and a new business had  to be created to fit those needs. Top talent was pooled together to create a team that could build new and interesting applications that were fun to use, and easy to navigate. <br><br>

AquaInk was essentially created at this point, and today strives to be the tip of the spear in web applications. We wear a lot of hats here at Aqua Ink, so feel free to challenge us and task us with hard projects. It would be our honor to help  you tackle them.<br><br>

Thanks for stopping by!<br>
